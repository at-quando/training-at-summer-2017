Ruby is a scripting language.
Today, I've learnt about some basic ruby concepts about syntax and control flow.

## SYNTAX
### Declaring Variable Name
>  There are two kind of declaring such as snake_case and CamelCase.
> In ruby, people usually declare variable name by snake_case. This means we will have "_" between each word.
### Comment
> There are two kind of commenting in Ruby:
> - uses character "#" if you want to comment in one line
> - use =begin, =end and puts your comment paragraph in this, if you want to comment more than one line.

### Print, Puts , Return, Yield
> - Print: will show your sentence to the screen and on the same line 
> - Puts: will create a new line and puts your sentence on this. 
> - Return: The return command just returns the value of something. If you don’t tell ruby what to return, it will always return the last expression in the method code block.
> - Yield: The yield command allows for methods to accept a block of code. It transfers control from the method to the block and back to the method again. 

## CONTROL FLOWS
There are five things which related to control flow. Those are if, if else, if elseif, unless, case.
> - *If Statements*
We have conditions. if it`s true, the compiler will run your command. If not, it will not do anything.

> - *If else Statements*
It`s like if statements, but when the conditions of command does not meet to the conditions of input, it will do another command in the else statement.

> - *If elseif Statements*
it`s almost like if else statements, but it has more conditions than ever.

> - *Switch Case Statements*
It`s like an elseif statement, but better for situations when we have multiple conditions.
It allows you to put multiple when statements, or conditions, and then which ever one is true, it will run that condition. 

> - *Unless Statements*
We use unless while we want to use control flow to see if a statement is false, rather than if it’s true.
